# SpyStore
Project from Phillip Japikse's book "Building web applications with  .net core 2.1" 
It served as an exercise in doing a large project. Got a taste of coding a middle sized project, instead of NewtonSoftJson used build in framework features (got an idea from StackOverflow), transported from .net core 2.1 to net core 3. 
Entity Framework changed from core 2 to core 3 thus i adressed that issue too in the code. 
Doing this, and other execrises that stored here was more fun than learning Richter's clr via book by heart chapter by chapter as demanded for trainee position interviews in my country.
