# SpyStore
Project from Phillip Japikse's book "Building web applications with  .net core 2.1" 
It served as an exercise in doing a large project. Got a taste of coding a middle sized project, instead of NewtonSoftJson used build in framework features (got an idea from StackOverflow), transported from .net core 2.1 to net core 3. 
Entity Framework changed from core 2 to core 3 thus i adressed that issue too in the code.
